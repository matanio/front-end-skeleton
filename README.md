# Front-end Web Skeleton

This is one of my pre-made projects for my quick vue web-app ideas. The template includes Tailwind CSS and Vue 3 + Vite, and hence includes the scripts from Vite. It also incldues some customisability. 

**TLDR**: I have millions of ideas for quick projects - this speeds up the proccess.
